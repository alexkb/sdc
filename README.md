# Stamp duty calculator for Australian real estate

## Purpose
This mobile application is a calculator for estimating stamp duty due on Australian real estate. Each state in Australia calculates its stamp duty differently and therefore requires different questions and calculations.

Please note, that the information provided by the calculator is intended to provide illustrative examples based on stated assumptions and your inputs. Calculations are meant as estimates only and it is advised that you consult with a mortgage broker about your specific circumstances. It should be noted that the application is licensed under the GPL and therefore (among other things) does not come with any warranty.

## About

This code is an educational project for learning the hybrid mobile framework [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) and the modern JS framework [Angular](http://angularjs.org).

It uses google's geolocation service to automatically select the correct state or territory that the user resides in.

It was originally written by [Alex Bergin](http://alexbergin.com) in the summer of 2014/15.

Any peer review and criticisms of this code is very much welcome. Feel free to either open an issue on github.com, fork and/or merge request, etc.
