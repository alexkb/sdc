# Australian Stamp Duty calculator

This application provides a calculator for estimating stamp duty (tax) due on Australian property. Each state in Australia calculators its stamp duty differently, and therefore requires different questions and calculations.

Please note, that the information provided by the calculator is intended to provide illustrative examples based on stated assumptions and your inputs. Calculations are meant as estimates only and it is advised that you consult with a mortgage broker about your specific circumstances
